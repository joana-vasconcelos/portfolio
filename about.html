          <h2>Joana Vasconcelos</h2>
          <p>
            Since I was young all I wanted was to help biodiversity and the
            environment, so I thought Environmental Engineering would be best
            for me. It was mainly when I started working that I realised I
            didn't really care for this job. So I decided to take some time to
            think and try to understand what I wanted to do.
            <br />
            <br />

            For a while I worked as a store operator, which helped me a lot
            socially and where I was part of a great team. It also allowed me to
            organise a lot of the store, which helped with my creativity and
            love for design and aesthetic.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meanwhile, I applied for a Minor in Biology, while maintaining my
            job as a store operator. I then decided to apply for a Master's
            degree in Evolutionary and Developmental Biology. Suffice to say,
            I've loved the Evolutionary part of the course, but my favourite
            courses always involved a lot of computer use and some type of
            programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the pandemic I've decided to expand my knowledge in
            programming, so I decided to start the SheCodes workshops, which
            have been a great learning tool that allowed me to know about HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, API, React and Responsive.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of these experiences made me want to apply to a job in web
            development, while maintaining my love for biology and environment
            as a hobby.
            <br />
            <br />
            My journey also made me realise that I'm always eager to learn new
            things. Right now I'm working on finishing my thesis and improve my
            coding skills. My next goals are to learn some Python and to start
            learning German.
